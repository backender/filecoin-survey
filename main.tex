\section{Introduction}

"A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF STORAGE SITS UNUSED IN DATA CENTERS AND HARD DRIVES AROUND THE WORLD."
With this slogan Protocol Labs is about to disrupt the storage market by using \textit{proof-of-spacetime} as their driving source.
The Filecoin project describes a decentralized storage market where anyone, worldwide, is able to participate as a storage provider.
The concept is indeed promising and convinced the investors such that a total of \$257 million had been raised â€“-- the biggest initial coin offering (ICO) as of today (September 2017).

Decentralized storage market is not a novel concept.
Others[Tribler, TorCoin, Mojo Nation] have tried in past too, but yet were not able to scale as much as Filecoin advertises to do, and eventually failed.
More recent projects [StorJ, Swarm, Sia, MaidSAFE] are currently working towards building a similar system with conceptual differences which will be uncovered briefly in this paper.

This paper aims to analyze the ICO launch of Filecoin and reasons about the exceptionally large investment using heavily discussed topics in social media channels.
Further, the feasibility in terms of technical as well as economical design is studied.
We aim to uncover potential weaknesses but also highlight strengths of the proposed white-paper [Whitepaper].
The incorporated \textit{proof-of-spacetime} consensus algorithm is being highlighted and compared with consensus proposals from projects such as StorJ and Sia.
Eventually, the ICO launch is opposed to the scientific "1975 rule", a model of a pyramid scheme [Pyramid Scheme] and the feasibility is confronted with the "speculative bubble" model [Bubble].

The structure of this paper is as follows:

\section{15 years of documented failure}

\section{ICO analysis}

\subsection{Investors exclusion}

\section{Is the design technically feasible?}

\section{Is the design economically feasible?}

\section{Is this a pyramid scheme?}

\section{Is it a bubble?}

In a recent interview [Podcast], Juan Benet compares Filecoin with Airbnb [Airbnb] where people can rent away storage, instead of their homes.
As of today (September 2017), Airbnb values at approximately \$31 billion [airbnb-valuation] while holding around 3 million listings in total [airbnb-valuation].
The average apartment in the United States was 934 square feet in 2016 [housing-cnbc].
In a hypothetical scenario, Airbnb is therefore valued \$$11.06$ per square feet. 
If one would compare this number to the median price per square feet in the United States, which is \$123, the Airbnb ecosystem diminishes the median price by a factor of $11.12$.
The average price for hard drives in 2017 is \$0.03 per Gigabyte [Hard-drive].
Dividing the same factor as Airbnb applies for square feet to the storage price, the average Gigabyte in the Filecoin system results in \$0.0027.
This in fact means, the \$$257'000'000$ launched at the Filecoin ICO require $95'185'185'185$ Gigabyte ($95'185$ Petabyte) of storage to be offered by storage miners.
Considering that Dropbox [dropbox] holds currently around $500$ Petabyte of user data [dropbox-userdata], one could argue that Filecoin is overvalued.
