\section{Introduction}

\begin{quote}"A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF STORAGE SITS UNUSED IN DATA CENTERS AND HARD DRIVES AROUND THE WORLD." \cite{filecoin-io}\end{quote}
With this slogan Protocol Labs is about to disrupt the storage market by using \textit{proof-of-spacetime} as their driving source.
The Filecoin project describes a decentralized storage market where anyone, worldwide, is able to participate as a storage provider.
The concept is indeed promising and convinced the investors such that a total of \$257 million had been raised –-- the biggest initial coin offering (ICO) as of today (September 2017).

However, the idea of a decentralized storage market is not a novel concept.
Others\cite{tribler}\cite{mojo-nation} have tried in past too, but yet were not able to scale as much as Filecoin advertises to do, and eventually failed.
More recent projects\cite{storj}\cite{sia} are currently working towards building a similar system with conceptual differences which will be uncovered briefly in this paper.

This paper aims to analyze the ICO launch of Filecoin and reasons about the exceptionally large investment using heavily discussed topics in social media channels.
Further, the feasibility in terms of technical as well as economical design is studied.
We aim to uncover potential weaknesses but also highlight strengths of the proposed white-paper \cite{filecoin}.
The incorporated \textit{proof-of-spacetime} consensus algorithm is being highlighted and compared with consensus proposals from projects such as StorJ and Sia.
Eventually, the ICO launch is opposed to the \textit{scientific 1975 rule}, a model of a pyramid scheme\cite{pyramid-scheme} and the feasibility is confronted with the \textit{speculative bubble model}\cite{bubble}.

The structure of this paper is as follows: Section \ref{sec:documented-failure} lays out a history of decentralized storage projects with a similar ambition as Filecoin, but that have failed over time. 
The following Section \ref{sec:ico-analysis} is an introduction to the Filecoin project by analyzing the ICO including the reasoning about the applied investor exclusion provision.


\section{15 years of documented failure}
\label{sec:documented-failure}

In July 2000, long before the blockchain era, the Mojo Nation software \cite{mojo-nation} was released, aiming to serve an "emergent file store" to its users.
The project successfully deployed a decentralized storage network in an environment consisting of unmanaged nodes.
It used consistent hashing \cite{consistent-hashing} to locate nodes and data blocks.
However, the project was shut down in February 2002 due to a number of problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data Availability: the main issue was the inconsistency of data available to its users as it depended upon which server nodes were connected at the given time.
According to Maymounkov et al.\cite{peer-to-peer-xor} this could have been avoided by heuristically favoring long-lived nodes and by discriminating newly joined nodes which show a frequent join- and leave behaviour.
\item Firewalls and NAT: networking hurdles such as firewalls and network address translation (NAT) prevented a substantial amount of nodes to act as a server.
\item Mutual distrust: in order to have a network of nodes to behave as designed a \textit{motivation to cooperate} needs to be established within the network, combined with sophisticated \textit{attack resistance} mechanism which prevents nodes from using resources of other nodes without offering equal amounts of services in return.
\end{itemize}
\hfill
\\
Also academia has been struggling to succeed in building self-organizing.
Tribler\cite{tribler} is based on robust reputation and craft collaboration, an environment where one could think of a decentralized marketplace which can handle storage as an asset.
The 12 years of development is a history affected by many hurdles.
Security issues such as collusion attacks\cite{tribler-hurdles} have slowed down the development progress enormously, preventing the project to scale.

\section{ICO analysis}
\label{sec:ico-analysis}

The Filecoin ICO start on August 10, 2017 and closed the offering on September 7th.
It was the first ICO ever, complying with SEC securities regulations, such that only accredited investors were allowed to contribute (Reg. D, 506(c), see \cite{regulation-506}).
Further was the ICO conducted using CoinList\cite{coinlist}, a platform for token sales, built by Protocol Labs too.
CoinList partners with AngelList\cite{angellist} whose responsibility is on the compliance side regarding the law.
In total, approximately \$257'000'000 was raised, formed of \$52'000'000 from presale and \$205'800'000 Reg D investments.
For the latter category, \$135 million was raised within the first hour.

%People who previously made investments in a pre-sale that was run will get a discount, their price will be 75 cents per token.

%If you invest, you will be purchasing a SAFT, which is an instrument that Protocol Labs came up with to legally deliver tokens at a future date. It stands for Simple Agreement for Future Tokens.

\subsection{Questioning investors exclusion}



\section{Is the design technically feasible?}

In this section, technical details will be highlighted with reasoning whether the decisions stated in the Whitepaper\cite{filecoin} are chosen appropriately or arise potential weaknesses.
We further aim to make comparisons to more recent decentralized storage projects involving a blockchain, such as StorJ \cite{storj} and Sia \cite{Sia}.

\section{Is this a pyramid scheme?}

\section{Is it a bubble?}

In a recent interview \cite{podcast}, Juan Benet compares Filecoin with Airbnb \cite{airbnb} where people can rent away storage, instead of their homes.
As of today (September 2017), Airbnb values at approximately \$31 billion while holding around 3 million listings in total \cite{airbnb-valuation}.
The average apartment in the United States was 934 square feet in 2016 \cite{housing-cnbc}.
In a hypothetical scenario, Airbnb is therefore valued \$$11.06$ per square feet. 
If one would compare this number to the median price per square feet in the United States, which is \$123 \cite{home-prices}, the Airbnb ecosystem diminishes the median price by a factor of $11.12$.
The average price for hard drives in 2017 is \$0.03 per Gigabyte \cite{hard-drive}.
Dividing the same factor as Airbnb applies for square feet to the storage price, the average Gigabyte in the Filecoin system results in \$0.0027.
This in fact means, the \$$257'000'000$ launched at the Filecoin ICO require $95'185'185'185$ Gigabyte ($95'185$ Petabyte) of storage to be offered by storage miners.
Considering that Dropbox \cite{dropbox} holds currently around $500$ Petabyte of user data \cite{dropbox-userdata}, one could argue that Filecoin is overvalued.
